      ref="slide_introduction">Mutual Coherence </h2>

  The
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_coherence_(linear_algebra),mutual
  coherence], $\mu(A)$, of a matrix $A$ characterizes the spread of
  its columns, and is useful in the theory and application of
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing,compressive
  sensing]. Roughly speaking, it is the cosine of the minimum angle
  between any two columns of $A$. More precisely, the mutual coherence
  is the maximum absolute value of the
  <span class="pz_text" ref="angle_note">inner product between any two
    normalized columns </span> $a_j$ and $a_k$:

  $$
  \mu(A)=\max\limits_{1\leq k,j\leq m, k\neq j } 
  \frac{|a_k^T a_j|}{\|a_k\|_2 \|a_j\|_2} 
  $$
 
  If we consider the columns of $A$ as vectors (with magnitude and
  direction), the mutual coherence tells us something about how __well
  spread__ the directions of a collection of vectors are (at least,
  how well spread the two __least__ spread vectors are). The mutual
  coherence is in the range $0 \leq \mu \leq 1$, with lower values
  indicating a greater spread.

  <div class="pz_note" id="angle_note">
    The inner product between normalized columns (vectors if you
    prefer) is a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product,generalization] of the
    cosine of the angle between those columns/vectors.

  For example, say $A$ consists of a red, blue and green vector

  $$
  A=\begin{bmatrix}
  \color{red}{1}&\color{blue}{-1}&\color{green}{1}\\
  \color{red}{1}&\color{blue}{2}&\color{green}{4}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  Plotting the three colored vectors yields a 
  <span class='pz_slide_link' ref='slide_3vec'> geometric
    interpretation</span> of $A$---each color corresponds to a
    different column. The first row (i.e., first coefficient in a
    column) corresponds to the horizontal axis, and the second row
    corresponds to the vertical axis.

  The cosine of the angle between any two vectors ranges between $-1$
  and $1$, and its absolute value between $0$ and $1$. The mutual
  coherence is the absolute value of the cosine of the *smallest*
  angle between any of the vectors.

  In this case the smallest angle is between the first column,
  $[\color{red}{1~1}]^T$, and third column
  $[\color{green}{1~4}]^T$. The angle is about $31^\circ$ and the
  absolute value of the cosine is $\mu \approx 0.86$. Lets now
  consider how to compute $\mu(A)$ in practice.

  <h3 class="pz_section" id="computation" ref="slide_computation">
    Computation
  </h3>

  We can <span class="pz_text" ref="comp_size_note">compute</span>
  $\mu(A)$ by first normalizing the columns of $A$ to $A_n$,
  then <span class="pz_text" ref="mcoh_comp_note">choosing the largest
  off-diagonal term of $A_n^T A_n$</span>. In CoffeeScript:

  <div class="pz_note" id="comp_size_note">
    For very large $A$ this method will be slow and require a lot of
    RAM---but it is perfectly fine for moderately sized problems.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="mcoh_comp_note">
    Every off-diagonal element of $A_n^T A_n$ is an inner product of
    two normalized columns of $A$. The same normalized inner products
    that appear in the definition of $\mu(A)$ above.
  </div>

  <div data-file="mcoh.coffee"></div>

  For example, using $A$ from above (edit then shift+enter):

  <div class="left_col">
    <div data-file="main.coffee"></div>
  </div>    

  <div class="right_col">
    <div data-eval="main.coffee"></div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="pz_section" id="bound" ref="slide_bound">Bound</h3>

  <pzthumb src="./python/bound_plot.svg" ref="slide_bound"/>

  <span class="pz_text" ref="bruckstein_note">There is a limit to how
    well spread a collection of vectors can possibly be </span>.  The
    minimum angle for *three* vectors in *two* dimensions is
    $120^\circ$ or less---we cannot move them any further
    apart. Therefore, any matrix with three columns and two rows can
    have a mutual coherence no less than $\mu=|\cos(120^\circ)|=0.5$.

  More generally, for a matrix with $M$ rows and $N$ columns and $N>M$
  we have a <span class="pz_text" ref="full_rank_note">bound</span>
  $\mu\geq\mu_0$, where

  $$
  \mu_0 = \sqrt{\frac{N-M}{M(N-1)}}
  $$

  It is helpfull to consider the edge cases $N=M+1$ and $N\gg M$,
  which yields the left and right boundaries in

  $$
  \frac{1}{M} \leq \mu_0 < \frac{1}{\sqrt M}
  $$

  As $M$ increases, we get a higher-dimensional space and thus it is
  easier to achieve a large spread in vectors, or a small mutual
  coherence.  Mutual coherence increases with $N$ (the number of
  vectors in the space), from a minimum of $1/M$ up to a limit
  $1/\sqrt M$, for evenly-spaced vectors.

  <div class="pz_note" id="full_rank_note">
    Strictly this bound is for matrices with full rank. 
    $\mu=\mu_0$ corresponds to evenly spaced vectors.
